[See Demo](http://alexandercurtis.github.io/fx451/fx451.html)

A Javascript simulation of the Casio fx-451 (or fx-451M) calculator. (Written in 2008, when ECMAScript 3 ruled.)

Not all the functions work yet (i.e. stuff on the right hand panel) but you can do basic arithmetic and a few other things. For more info see the files in `doc/`.

## To run

Open `./production/fx451.html` in a web browser.
